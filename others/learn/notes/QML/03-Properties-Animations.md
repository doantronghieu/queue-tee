# Qt QML Transformations and Animations: Complete Study Guide

## 1. Understanding Transformations
- A transformation changes an object using its properties
- Types of transformations:
  - Position (x, y)
  - Size (width, height)
  - Rotation
  - Scale
  - Opacity
  - Translation

## 2. Property Animation Basics

### Core Concepts
```qml
PropertyAnimation {
    id: animationId
    target: objectToAnimate
    property: "propertyName"  // Case sensitive!
    to: endValue
    duration: milliseconds
}
```

### Important Points
- Animations are property changes over time
- Property names must be exact (case-sensitive)
- Duration is in milliseconds (1000ms = 1 second)
- Can animate multiple properties simultaneously
- Best to use start() instead of running: true

### Common Mistakes
- Misspelling property names
- Using running: true inappropriately
- Incorrect ID references
- Missing duration specification

## 3. Rotation Animation

### Basic Implementation
```qml
RotationAnimation {
    id: rotationAnim
    target: myShape
    from: 0
    to: 360
    duration: 3000
    direction: RotationAnimation.Clockwise
    loops: Animation.Infinite
}
```

### Key Features
- Can specify rotation direction
- Supports infinite loops
- Can pause/resume animations
- Difference between pause() and paused
  - pause(): Function to stop animation
  - paused: Property indicating state

### Best Practices
- Avoid negative rotation values
- Use direction property instead of negative numbers
- Center point is rotation anchor by default

## 4. Scale Animation

### Implementation
```qml
ScaleAnimator {
    id: scaleAnim
    target: myShape
    from: 1.0
    to: 0.5
    duration: 2000
}
```

### Key Concepts
- Scale values are multipliers (1.0 = 100%)
- Can scale uniformly or on individual axes
- Often combined with other animations
- Maintains center point during scaling

## 5. Sequential Animations

### Basic Structure
```qml
SequentialAnimation {
    running: true
    loops: Animation.Infinite

    ScaleAnimator {
        target: myShape
        from: 1.0
        to: 0.5
        duration: 2000
    }

    RotationAnimation {
        target: myShape
        from: 0
        to: 360
        duration: 2000
    }
}
```

### Features
- Runs animations in sequence
- Can combine different animation types
- Parent controls running state
- Child animations don't need running: true

## 6. Opacity Animation

### Implementation
```qml
SequentialAnimation {
    running: true
    loops: Animation.Infinite

    OpacityAnimator {
        target: ghost
        from: 0
        to: 1
        duration: 1000  // Quick fade in
    }
    OpacityAnimator {
        target: ghost
        from: 1
        to: 0
        duration: 5000  // Slow fade out
    }
}
```

### Characteristics
- Values range from 0.0 to 1.0
- Useful for fade effects
- Can create ghost-like animations
- Different durations for interesting effects

## 7. Transform and Translate

### Basic Usage
```qml
Rectangle {
    id: myRect
    anchors.centerIn: parent
    transform: Translate {
        x: 100  // Offset from anchored position
        y: 100
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- Moves items without changing x/y properties
- Works with anchored items
- Can use negative offsets
- Maintains original position reference
- Useful for relative movements

## 8. Smooth Animation

### Implementation
```qml
Rectangle {
    id: movingRect
    
    Behavior on x {
        SmoothedAnimation {
            velocity: 200
        }
    }
    Behavior on y {
        SmoothedAnimation {
            velocity: 200
        }
    }

    focus: true
    Keys.onRightPressed: x += 100
    Keys.onLeftPressed: x -= 100
}
```

### Features
- Uses velocity instead of duration
- Creates smooth transitions
- Requires focus for keyboard input
- Good for following movements
- Common velocity range: 50-300

## 9. Anti-aliasing

### Usage
```qml
Rectangle {
    antialiasing: true  // Default
    // or
    antialiasing: false  // For performance
}
```

### Considerations
- Enabled by default
- Smooths edges of shapes
- Can disable for performance
- Important for circles/curves
- Consider device capabilities

## 10. Width/Height Transformations

### Keyboard Control Example
```qml
Rectangle {
    id: background
    focus: true

    Rectangle {
        id: rect1
        anchors.centerIn: parent
        width: 100
        height: 100
        
        Keys.onUpPressed: height += 10
        Keys.onDownPressed: height -= 10
        Keys.onRightPressed: width += 10
        Keys.onLeftPressed: width -= 10
    }
}
```

### Important Notes
- Requires focus: true
- Can modify independently
- Consider visual feedback
- Can combine with animations
- Consider min/max constraints

## Best Practices Summary
